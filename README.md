# Safety of AI. Final Project

The final project is dedicated to broadening the knowledge and skills acquired in lectures, seminars and task assignments of the course. Here is the list of ToDos you should address to pass:

1. Find a research work with an AI application where safety is either addressed explicitly or you suggest it should have been (the harder way)

2. Study the work, try to reproduce it, say, as a case study, or extend on the work -- for instance, the work presented a method for guaranteeing safety, use it in your application of choice

3. Findings should be documented and reflected in a presentation

Here is a typical structure of a presentation:

- Summary of the studied work, the (safety) problem addressed (should be 1 slide)
- Summary of the related theory (should be 1 slide)
- Problem setup, flowcharts, diagrams etc. (should be 1 slide)
- Summary of code, better with schematic/graphic exposition (2-3 slides)
- Results & discussion + brief conclusion (2-3 slides, what have you observed and learned from the results? Think of how you could make use of it in terms of a potential publication or a skill in future career in industry)

The presentation should take no longer than 10 minutes plus 5 minutes for a discussion.

The presentation document itself can be done in any format you like, whether it's MS Office or TeX/Beamer.

Organize all your work in a Github repo following way:

* **code**: code directly related to the final project 

* **bib**: bibliography files, say, bibs if you're using BibTeX. Better organize by topic

* **gfx**: graphical material, including not only .pngs, .svgs etc., but also "source" files such as .tikz, .tex, .fig etc.

* **extras**: everything related to the project which does not belong in other folders

* **lit**: literature: books, papers etc.

***Important! Don't forget to add your tempopary file extensions to .gitignore to keep the repo clean***
